## Purpose

A company I applied to handed me homework to complete and give back. It was a PSD file which they wanted me to turn into an HTML/CSS website. Some of the criteria for the website included "Modals", "Carousel", and "Responsive Design". <br />
<br />
After I returned the homework I was left with the desire to add the assignment to my resume. So I searched online for some templates and created my own version: Tri-Health!

## Usage

Simply visit the website by clicking this [link](https://d-whipp.github.io/tri-health-demosite/) or by visting the URL at (https://d-whipp.github.io/tri-health-demosite/). <br>
Once there feel free to explore the site. I am still ironing out the responsiveness.
